The Racket Programming Language
===============================

This is the Racket v5.3.2 package for Mac OS X (Intel 64-bit).

Install by dragging the enclosing Racket folder to your Applications folder
--- or wherever you like. You can move the Racket folder at any time, but do not
move applications or other files within the folder. If you want to use the
Racket command-line programs, then (optionally) add the path of the "bin"
subdirectory to your PATH environment variable.

The main executables in this package:

* DrRacket: Racket's integrated development environment (start here!).

* racket: command-line tool for running Racket programs.

* raco: command-line tool for compilation, documentation, and more.


More Information
----------------

For Racket documentation, use DrRacket's `Help' menu, run the `Racket
Documentation' application (Windows or Mac OS X), or run `raco docs'
from a command line.
